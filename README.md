# js-react-class-projects
A set of small projects for a react class that I am putting on

There are three projects, to try a project navigate to the folder and type:
`npm install`
then -
`yarn start`
The project should automatically load in the browser

The projects are -
- a tic-tac-toe game
- a meme generator
- a chat application
